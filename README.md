# Food Classification App using Deep Learning with PyTorch and FastAPI in Docker.

## Tools used
This was built with PyTorch/FastAI for the Deep Learning part and Flask as a Webserver. <br/>
For containerization and easy deployment I use Docker. <br/>
The dataset in use is the Food-101 Dataset but I only use 10 of the foods contained there that are 'samosa','churros','sushi','tacos','pizza','tiramisu','cheesecake','ice_cream','donuts','pancakes'.
